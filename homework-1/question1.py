# Example of how my code works:
# The first customer is using the Cash Register:
customer_1 = CashRegister()

# Suppose Customer 1 is shopping at Asos for their holiday, and scans their items:

customer_1.add_item({'ASOS Design Pink Dress': 35.00})
customer_1.add_item({'New Look Brown Sandals': 15.00})
customer_1.add_item({'ASOS Design Denim Shorts': 25.00})
customer_1.add_item({'Pull&Bear Round Sunglasses': 13.00})
customer_1.add_item({'Garnier Gradual Tan': 10.00})
customer_1.add_item({'New Look Black Sandals': 15.00})

# Customer 1 has noticed that they added Sandals to their register twice
# They need to remove this item:

customer_1.remove_item('New Look Black Sandals')

# Customer 1 has just found out that Asos are having a holiday sale
# They are offering customers 40% off their basket
# Customer 1 applies the discount:

customer_1.apply_discount(40)

# Customer 1 would like to see their items, their total basket price, and how much they saved:

customer_1.show_items()
print(customer_1.get_total())

# Customer 1 has now finished at the Cash Register and the Cash Register is cleared:

customer_1.reset_register()

# Customer 2 would now like to buy some items for their holiday:

customer_2 = CashRegister()

# Customer 2 adds their items to the Cash Register:

customer_2.add_item({'QUAY Sunglasses': 49.00})
customer_2.add_item({'ASOS Design Swim Shorts': 16.00})
customer_2.add_item({'Topman Black Shorts': 20.00})
customer_2.add_item({'Ralph Lauren Polo': 95.00})

# Customer 2 also takes advantage of the 40% discount:

customer_2.apply_discount(40)

# Customer 2 would like to see their items, their total basket price, and how much they saved:

customer_2.show_items()
print(customer_2.get_total())

# The Cash Register is cleared ready for the next customer

customer_2.reset_register()
